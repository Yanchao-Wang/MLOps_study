# MLOps: Exercises

This repository contains my personal progress and exercise solutions for the [DTU-MLOps](https://skaftenicki.github.io/dtu_mlops/latest/) course. I am following this material as part of a self-study group to learn how to build, scale, and deploy machine learning systems.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

My goal is to master the **Operations** phase of the ML lifecycle:

* **Organization**: Structuring code for maintainability and shareability.


* **Reproducibility**: Creating containerized applications and experiments.


* **Automation**: Implementing Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Machine Learning (CML).


* **Monitoring**: Profiling and monitoring experiments to assess model performance.


* **Scalability**: Using cloud services and distributed training paradigms.


* **Deployment**: Deploying models locally and in the cloud.



## 🛠 Toolbox & Tech Stack

I am using a variety of tools throughout this course to build a professional MLOps "toolbox":

* **Framework**: PyTorch.


* **Dependency Management**: `uv` and `pip`.


* **Core Tools**: Docker, GitHub Actions, and cloud-based computing services.
